Just a small memory game made to learn ReactJS and also Bootstrap 4.

How to run it:  
* Insert images for 16 pairs (hard coded currently, see comments)
* Run `npm run start` to start a new match.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
